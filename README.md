# SRE Fundamentals with Google Week 2 Project

In this week's project, we encounter a scenario where UpCommerce's site service is down after some changes made by the development team.
We are tasked to resolve problems that have happened in UpCommerce's Kubernetes cluster and using information from alerts. For full 
practice, we should also keep the Incident Commander (IC) and Communications Lead (CL) up to date.
